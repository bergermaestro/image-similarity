- first when it is just the image by itself
- second - what if the logo is in combination with a bunch of other images?

- canada_10 poses a bit of an issue - case where it's just the department logo and the canada flag - what if we split and detect on the Canadian flag instead?
- canada_12 with the circle around it
- canada_13 - didn't detect any logos
- canada_21 just department logo and canada flag

starting to think I should just make a classifier for the canada flag
